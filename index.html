       <h2>
        About Me
       </h2>

       <p>
        I'm a <strong>Computer Engineer</strong> from Rutgers New Brunswick 
        with a passion for <strong>Web/App Development, Cyber Security,</strong>
        and <strong>Video Game Development.</strong>
       </p>

       <p>
        What makes me stand out is my love for learning, inability 
        to stop at a problem till I solve it, and my ability to 
        shine with people who work with me and shine alone as well.
       </p>

       <p>
        I'm currently looking for a position that will last me for
        at least 10 years. I'm interested in growing in a company and 
        creating something that will be remembered for a lifetime!
